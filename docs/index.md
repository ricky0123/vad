# Welcome

This is the new documentation for [VAD](https://github.com/ricky0123/vad), a Javascript package for voice activity detection. VAD lets you prompt your user for microphone permissions and run callbacks on segments of audio with user speech in a few lines of code.

Be aware that this documentation may not always be up-to-date. You can always supplement this documentation by checking the [examples](https://github.com/ricky0123/vad/tree/master/examples), [source code](https://github.com/ricky0123/vad/tree/master/packages), or searching [Discord](https://discord.gg/4WPeGEaSpF) or [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ricky0123/vad/issues).
